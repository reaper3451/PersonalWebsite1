This repository contains a minimal static HTML/CSS scaffold that reproduces the site's structure (hero, skills, posts, connect) using placeholder content. It does NOT copy long original text or images.

To preview locally:

```bash
# from repository root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps:
- Confirm whether you want exact content copied (you must have permission) or placeholders
- Replace placeholder content and images with real content
- Add blog engine or RSS if desired
